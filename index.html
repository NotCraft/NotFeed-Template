<span><p>Relevance in summarization is typically defined based on textual information
alone, without incorporating insights about a particular decision. As a result,
to support risk analysis of pancreatic cancer, summaries of medical notes may
include irrelevant information such as a knee injury. We propose a novel
problem, decision-focused summarization, where the goal is to summarize
relevant information for a decision. We leverage a predictive model that makes
the decision based on the full text to provide valuable insights on how a
decision can be inferred from text. To build a summary, we then select
representative sentences that lead to similar model decisions as using the full
text while accounting for textual non-redundancy. To evaluate our method
(DecSum), we build a testbed where the task is to summarize the first ten
reviews of a restaurant in support of predicting its future rating on Yelp.
DecSum substantially outperforms text-only summarization methods and
model-based explanation methods in decision faithfulness and
representativeness. We further demonstrate that DecSum is the only method that
enables humans to outperform random chance in predicting which restaurant will
be better rated in the future.

less curated data, a number of preprocessing tools are built and their
importance is shown empirically. To facilitate faster iteration of development

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06935">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recent work has shown evidence that the knowledge acquired by multilingual
BERT (mBERT) has two components: a language-specific and a language-neutral
one. This paper analyses the relationship between them, in the context of
fine-tuning on two tasks -- POS tagging and natural language inference -- which
require the model to bring to bear different degrees of language-specific
knowledge. Visualisations reveal that mBERT loses the ability to cluster
representations by language after fine-tuning, a result that is supported by
evidence from language identification experiments. However, further experiments
on 'unlearning' language-specific representations using gradient reversal and
iterative adversarial learning are shown not to add further improvement to the
language-independent component over and above the effect of fine-tuning. The
results presented here suggest that the process of fine-tuning causes a
reorganisation of the model's limited representational capacity, enhancing
language-independent representations at the expense of language-specific ones.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06939">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Multi-task learning with transformer encoders (MTL) has emerged as a powerful
technique to improve performance on closely-related tasks for both accuracy and
efficiency while a question still remains whether or not it would perform as
well on tasks that are distinct in nature. We first present MTL results on five
NLP tasks, POS, NER, DEP, CON, and SRL, and depict its deficiency over
single-task learning. We then conduct an extensive pruning analysis to show
that a certain set of attention heads get claimed by most tasks during MTL, who
interfere with one another to fine-tune those heads for their own objectives.
Based on this finding, we propose the Stem Cell Hypothesis to reveal the
existence of attention heads naturally talented for many tasks that cannot be
jointly trained to create adequate embeddings for all of those tasks. Finally,
we design novel parameter-free probes to justify our hypothesis and demonstrate
how attention heads are transformed across the five tasks during MTL through
label analysis.

<span><p>Neural dialog models are known to suffer from problems such as generating

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are often optimized to work best
for speakers with canonical speech patterns. Unfortunately, these systems
perform poorly when tested on atypical speech and heavily accented speech. It
has previously been shown that personalization through model fine-tuning
substantially improves performance. However, maintaining such large models per
speaker is costly and difficult to scale. We show that by adding a relatively
small number of extra parameters to the encoder layers via so-called residual
adapter, we can achieve similar adaptation gains compared to model fine-tuning,
while only updating a tiny fraction (less than 0.5%) of the model parameters.
We demonstrate this on two speech adaptation tasks (atypical and accented

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Computational models of human language often involve combinatorial problems.
For instance, a probabilistic parser may marginalize over exponentially many
trees to make predictions. Algorithms for such problems often employ dynamic
programming and are not always unique. Finding one with optimal asymptotic
runtime can be unintuitive, time-consuming, and error-prone. Our work aims to
automate this laborious process. Given an initial correct declarative program,
we search for a sequence of semantics-preserving transformations to improve its
running time as much as possible. To this end, we describe a set of program
transformations, a simple metric for assessing the efficiency of a transformed
program, and a heuristic search procedure to improve this metric. We show that
in practice, automated search -- like the mental search performed by human

Empirically, we show that many common speed-ups described in the NLP literature

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia which is accompanied
by loss of memory and may lead to severe consequences in peoples' everyday life
if not diagnosed on time. Very few works have exploited transformer-based
networks and despite the high accuracy achieved, little work has been done in
terms of model interpretability. In addition, although Mini-Mental State Exam
(MMSE) scores are inextricably linked with the identification of dementia,
research works face the task of dementia identification and the task of the
prediction of MMSE scores as two separate tasks. In order to address these
limitations, we employ several transformer-based models, with BERT achieving
the highest accuracy accounting for 85.56%. Concurrently, we propose an
interpretable method to detect AD patients based on siamese networks reaching
accuracy up to 81.18%. Next, we introduce two multi-task learning models, where
the main task refers to the identification of dementia (binary classification),
while the auxiliary one corresponds to the identification of the severity of
dementia (multiclass classification). Our model obtains accuracy equal to
84.99% on the detection of AD patients in the multi-task learning setting.
Finally, we present some new methods to identify the linguistic patterns used
by AD patients and non-AD ones, including text statistics, vocabulary
uniqueness, word usage, correlations via a detailed linguistic analysis, and
explainability techniques (LIME). Findings indicate significant differences in
language between AD and non-AD patients.

<span><p>Understanding language requires grasping not only the overtly stated content,
but also making inferences about things that were left unsaid. These inferences
include presuppositions, a phenomenon by which a listener learns about new
information through reasoning about what a speaker takes as given.
Presuppositions require complex understanding of the lexical and syntactic
properties that trigger them as well as the broader conversational context. In
this work, we introduce the Naturally-Occurring Presuppositions in English
(NOPE) Corpus to investigate the context-sensitivity of 10 different types of
presupposition triggers and to evaluate machine learning models' ability to
predict human inferences. We find that most of the triggers we investigate
exhibit moderate variability. We further find that transformer-based models
draw correct inferences in simple cases involving presuppositions, but they
fail to capture the minority of exceptional cases in which human judgments
reveal complex interactions between context and triggers.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07009">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In this paper we propose a novel approach towards improving the efficiency of
Question Answering (QA) systems by filtering out questions that will not be
answered by them. This is based on an interesting new finding: the answer
confidence scores of state-of-the-art QA systems can be approximated well by
models solely using the input question text. This enables preemptive filtering
of questions that are not answered by the system due to their answer confidence
scores being lower than the system threshold. Specifically, we learn
Transformer-based question models by distilling Transformer-based answering
models. Our experiments on three popular QA datasets and one industrial QA
benchmark demonstrate the ability of our question models to approximate the
Precision/Recall curves of the target QA system well. These question models,
when used as filters, can effectively trade off lower computation cost of QA
systems for lower Recall, e.g., reducing computation by ~60%, while only losing
~3-4% of Recall.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Pre-trained language models perform well on a variety of linguistic tasks
that require symbolic reasoning, raising the question of whether such models
implicitly represent abstract symbols and rules. We investigate this question
using the case study of BERT's performance on English subject-verb agreement.
Unlike prior work, we train multiple instances of BERT from scratch, allowing
us to perform a series of controlled interventions at pre-training time. We
show that BERT often generalizes well to subject-verb pairs that never occurred
in training, suggesting a degree of rule-governed behavior. We also find,
however, that performance is heavily influenced by word frequency, with
experiments showing that both the absolute frequency of a verb form, as well as
the frequency relative to the alternate inflection, are causally implicated in
the predictions BERT makes at inference time. Closer analysis of these
frequency effects reveals that BERT's behavior is consistent with a system that
correctly applies the SVA rule in general but struggles to overcome strong
training priors and to estimate agreement features (singular vs. plural) on
infrequent lexical items.

expensive since they need to generate a perturbation for each sample in each

every several epochs. As caching all the perturbations imposes memory usage
concerns, we adopt a K-nearest neighbors-based strategy to tackle this issue.
The strategy only requires caching a small amount of perturbations, without
introducing additional training time. We evaluate our proposed method on a set
of neural machine translation and natural language understanding tasks. We
observe that ARCH significantly eases the computational burden (saves up to
70\% of computational time in comparison with conventional approaches). More
surprisingly, by reducing the variance of stochastic gradients, ARCH produces a

<span><p>Self-training achieves enormous success in various semi-supervised and
weakly-supervised learning tasks. The method can be interpreted as a
teacher-student framework, where the teacher generates pseudo-labels, and the
student makes predictions. The two models are updated alternatingly. However,
such a straightforward alternating update rule leads to training instability.
This is because a small change in the teacher may result in a significant
change in the student. To address this issue, we propose {\ours}, short for
differentiable self-training, that treats teacher-student as a Stackelberg
game. In this game, a leader is always in a more advantageous position than a
follower. In self-training, the student contributes to the prediction
performance, and the teacher controls the training process by generating
pseudo-labels. Therefore, we treat the student as the leader and the teacher as
the follower. The leader procures its advantage by acknowledging the follower's
strategy, which involves differentiable pseudo-labels and differentiable sample
weights. Consequently, the leader-follower interaction can be effectively
captured via Stackelberg gradient, obtained by differentiating the follower's
strategy. Experimental results on semi- and weakly-supervised classification

<span><p>This paper presents a simple and effective approach in low-resource named
entity recognition (NER) based on multi-hop dependency trigger. Dependency
trigger refer to salient nodes relative to a entity in the dependency graph of
a context sentence. Our main observation is that there often exists trigger
which play an important role to recognize the location and type of entity in
sentence. Previous research has used manual labelling of trigger. Our main
contribution is to propose use a syntactic parser to automatically annotate
trigger. Experiments on two English datasets (CONLL 2003 and BC5CDR) show that
the proposed method is comparable to the previous trigger-based NER model.

<span><p>The dialogue management component of a task-oriented dialogue system is
typically optimised via reinforcement learning (RL). Optimisation via RL is
highly susceptible to sample inefficiency and instability. The hierarchical
approach called Feudal Dialogue Management takes a step towards more efficient
learning by decomposing the action space. However, it still suffers from
instability due to the reward only being provided at the end of the dialogue.
We propose the usage of an intrinsic reward based on information gain to
address this issue. Our proposed reward favours actions that resolve
uncertainty or query the user whenever necessary. It enables the policy to
learn how to retrieve the users' needs efficiently, which is an integral aspect
in every task-oriented conversation. Our algorithm, which we call FeudalGain,
achieves state-of-the-art results in most environments of the PyDial framework,
outperforming much more complex approaches. We confirm the sample efficiency
and stability of our algorithm through experiments in simulation and a human

<span><p>Deep Contextual Language Models (LMs) like ELMO, BERT, and their successors
dominate the landscape of Natural Language Processing due to their ability to
scale across multiple tasks rapidly by pre-training a single model, followed by
task-specific fine-tuning. Furthermore, multilingual versions of such models
like XLM-R and mBERT have given promising results in zero-shot cross-lingual
transfer, potentially enabling NLP applications in many under-served and
under-resourced languages. Due to this initial success, pre-trained models are
being used as `Universal Language Models' as the starting point across diverse
tasks, domains, and languages. This work explores the notion of `Universality'
by identifying seven dimensions across which a universal model should be able
to scale, that is, perform equally well or reasonably well, to be useful across
diverse settings. We outline the current theoretical and empirical results that
support model performance across these dimensions, along with extensions that
may help address some of their current limitations. Through this survey, we lay
the foundation for understanding the capabilities and limitations of massive
contextual language models and help discern research gaps and directions for
future work to make these LMs inclusive and fair to diverse applications,

<span><p>Quality Estimation (QE) plays an essential role in applications of Machine
Translation (MT). Traditionally, a QE system accepts the original source text
and translation from a black-box MT system as input. Recently, a few studies
indicate that as a by-product of translation, QE benefits from the model and
training data's information of the MT system where the translations come from,
and it is called the "glass-box QE". In this paper, we extend the definition of
"glass-box QE" generally to uncertainty quantification with both "black-box"
and "glass-box" approaches and design several features deduced from them to
blaze a new trial in improving QE's performance. We propose a framework to fuse
the feature engineering of uncertainty quantification into a pre-trained

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07148">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recent advances in cultural analytics and large-scale computational studies
of art, literature and film often show that long-term change in the features of
artistic works happens gradually. These findings suggest that conservative
forces that shape creative domains might be underestimated. To this end, we
provide the first large-scale formal evidence of the persistent association
between poetic meter and semantics in 18-19th European literatures, using
Czech, German and Russian collections with additional data from English poetry
and early modern Dutch songs. Our study traces this association through a
series of clustering experiments using the abstracted semantic features of
150,000 poems. With the aid of topic modeling we infer semantic features for
individual poems. Texts were also lexically simplified across collections to
increase generalizability and decrease the sparseness of word frequency
distributions. Topics alone enable recognition of the meters in each observed
language, as may be seen from highly robust clustering of same-meter samples
(median Adjusted Rand Index between 0.48 and 1). In addition, this study shows
that the strength of the association between form and meaning tends to decrease
over time. This may reflect a shift in aesthetic conventions between the 18th
and 19th centuries as individual innovation was increasingly favored in
literature. Despite this decline, it remains possible to recognize semantics of
the meters from past or future, which suggests the continuity of semantic
traditions while also revealing the historical variability of conditions across
languages. This paper argues that distinct metrical forms, which are often
copied in a language over centuries, also maintain long-term semantic inertia
in poetry. Our findings, thus, highlight the role of the formal features of
cultural items in influencing the pace and shape of cultural evolution.

these powerful LMs can be used as domain-specific KBs. To this end, we create
the BioLAMA benchmark, which is comprised of 49K biomedical factual knowledge

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Mixup is a recent regularizer for current deep classification networks.
Through training a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of examples
and their labels, it imposes locally linear constraints on the model's input
space. However, such strict linear constraints often lead to under-fitting
which degrades the effects of regularization. Noticeably, this issue is getting
more serious when the resource is extremely limited. To address these issues,
we propose the Adversarial Mixing Policy (AMP), organized in a min-max-rand
formulation, to relax the Locally Linear Constraints in Mixup. Specifically,
AMP adds a small adversarial perturbation to the mixing coefficients rather
than the examples. Thus, slight non-linearity is injected in-between the
synthetic examples and synthetic labels. By training on these data, the deep
networks are further regularized, and thus achieve a lower predictive error
rate. Experiments on five text classification benchmarks and five backbone
models have empirically shown that our methods reduce the error rate over Mixup
variants in a significant margin (up to 31.3%), especially in low-resource
conditions (up to 17.5%).

perceptual categories and corresponding signs, formed by agents through
individual learning and semiotic communication between agents. (2) Function to
improve the categorization accuracy in an agent via semiotic communication with
another agent, even when some sensory modalities of each agent are missing. (3)
Function that an agent infers unobserved sensory information based on a sign
sampled from another agent in the same manner as cross-modal inference. We
propose an interpersonal multimodal Dirichlet mixture (Inter-MDM), which is
derived by dividing an integrative probabilistic generative model, which is
obtained by integrating two Dirichlet mixtures (DMs). The Markov chain Monte

demonstrated that Inter-MDM enables agents to form multimodal categories and

However, high-dimensional vectors can encode complex linguistic information

relation-oriented clustering model and use it to identify the novel relations
in the unlabeled data. Specifically, to enable the model to learn to cluster
relational data, our method leverages the readily available labeled data of
pre-defined relations to learn a relation-oriented representation. We minimize
distance between the instance with same relation by gathering the instances
towards their corresponding relation centroids to form a cluster structure, so
that the learned representation is cluster-friendly. To reduce the clustering
bias on predefined classes, we optimize the model by minimizing a joint
objective on both labeled and unlabeled data. Experimental results show that

<span><p>We propose a novel problem within end-to-end learning of task-oriented
dialogs (TOD), in which the dialog system mimics a troubleshooting agent who
helps a user by diagnosing their problem (e.g., car not starting). Such dialogs
are grounded in domain-specific flowcharts, which the agent is supposed to
follow during the conversation. Our task exposes novel technical challenges for
neural TOD, such as grounding an utterance to the flowchart without explicit
annotation, referring to additional manual pages when user asks a clarification
question, and ability to follow unseen flowcharts at test time. We release a
dataset (FloDial) consisting of 2,738 dialogs grounded on 12 different
troubleshooting flowcharts. We also design a neural model, FloNet, which uses a
retrieval-augmented generation architecture to train the dialog agent. Our
experiments find that FloNet can do zero-shot transfer to unseen flowcharts,
and sets a strong baseline for future research.

<span><p>Neural network-based methods are the state of the art in negation scope
resolution. However, they often use the unrealistic assumption that cue
information is completely accurate. Even if this assumption holds, there
remains a dependency on engineered features from state-of-the-art machine
learning methods. The current study adopted a two-step negation resolving
apporach to assess whether a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-based method
can be used for cue detection as well, and how inaccurate cue predictions would
affect the scope resolution performance. Results suggest that this method is
not suitable for negation detection. Scope resolution performance is most
robust against inaccurate information for models with a recurrent layer only,

of deep learning on negation detection and the effect of imperfect information

<span><p>Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architectures, while achieving
state-of-the-art results on a large number of NLP tasks, can still suffer from
overfitting during training. In practice, this is usually countered either by
applying regularization methods (e.g. dropout, L2-regularization) or by
providing huge amounts of training data. Additionally, Transformer and other
architectures are known to struggle when generating very long sequences. For
example, in machine translation, the neural-based systems perform worse on very
long sequences when compared to the preceding phrase-based translation
approaches (Koehn and Knowles, 2017).
</p>
<p>We present results which suggest that the issue might also be in the mismatch
between the length distributions of the training and validation data combined
with the aforementioned tendency of the neural networks to overfit to the
training data. We demonstrate on a simple string editing task and a machine
translation task that the Transformer model performance drops significantly
when facing sequences of length diverging from the length distribution in the
training data. Additionally, we show that the observed drop in performance is
due to the hypothesis length corresponding to the lengths seen by the model
during training rather than the length of the input sequence.

<span><p>Embedding based methods are widely used for unsupervised keyphrase extraction

phrase embeddings and document embedding, which is insufficient to capture
different context for a more effective UKE model. In this paper, we propose a
novel method for UKE, where local and global contexts are jointly modeled. From
a global view, we calculate the similarity between a certain phrase and the
whole document in the vector space as transitional embedding based models do.
In terms of the local view, we first build a graph structure based on the
document where phrases are regarded as vertices and the edges are similarities
between vertices. Then, we proposed a new centrality computation method to
capture local salient information based on the graph structure. Finally, we
further combine the modeling of global and local context for ranking. We
evaluate our models on three public benchmarks (Inspec, DUC 2001, SemEval 2010)
and compare with existing state-of-the-art models. The results show that our
model outperforms most models while generalizing better on input documents with
different domains and length. Additional ablation study shows that both the

<span><p>Compared to monolingual models, cross-lingual models usually require a more
expressive vocabulary to represent all languages adequately. We find that many

the limited vocabulary capacity. To this end, we propose an algorithm VoCap to
determine the desired vocabulary capacity of each language. However, increasing
the vocabulary size significantly slows down the pre-training speed. In order

Moreover, k-NN-based target sampling mitigates the side-effects of increasing

<span><p>Automatic annotation of short-text data to a large number of target labels,
referred to as Short Text Extreme Classification, has recently found numerous
applications in prediction of related searches and product recommendation
tasks. The conventional usage of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to capture
n-grams in text-classification relies heavily on uniformity in word-ordering
and the presence of long input sequences to convolve over. However, this is
missing in short and unstructured text sequences encountered in search and
recommendation. In order to tackle this, we propose an orthogonal approach by
recasting the convolution operation to capture coupled semantics along the
embedding dimensions, and develop a word-order agnostic embedding enhancement
module to deal with the lack of structure in such queries. Benefitting from the
computational efficiency of the convolution operation, Embedding Convolutions,
when applied on the enriched word embeddings, result in a light-weight and yet
powerful encoder (InceptionXML) that is robust to the inherent lack of
structure in short-text extreme classification.
</p>
<p>Towards scaling our model to problems with millions of labels, we also
propose InceptionXML+, which addresses the shortcomings of the dynamic
hard-negative mining framework in the recently proposed LightXML by improving
the alignment between the label-shortlister and extreme classifier. On popular
benchmark datasets, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art deep extreme classifiers such as Astec by an
average of 5% and 8% on the P@k and propensity-scored PSP@k metrics

<span><p>Incremental processing allows interactive systems to respond based on partial
inputs, which is a desirable property e.g. in dialogue agents. The currently
popular Transformer architecture inherently processes sequences as a whole,
abstracting away the notion of time. Recent work attempts to apply Transformers
incrementally via restart-incrementality by repeatedly feeding, to an unchanged
model, increasingly longer input prefixes to produce partial outputs. However,
this approach is computationally costly and does not scale efficiently for long
sequences. In parallel, we witness efforts to make Transformers more efficient,
e.g. the Linear Transformer (LT) with a recurrence mechanism. In this work, we
examine the feasibility of LT for incremental NLU in English. Our results show
that the recurrent LT model has better incremental performance and faster
inference speed compared to the standard Transformer and LT with
restart-incrementality, at the cost of part of the non-incremental (full
sequence) quality. We show that the performance drop can be mitigated by
training the model to wait for right context before committing to an output and
that training with input prefixes is beneficial for delivering correct partial
outputs.

However, in practical settings TableQA systems are deployed over table corpora
having topic and word distributions quite distinct from BERT's pretraining

designing novel challenge benchmarks WikiSQL-TS and WikiTQ-TS, consisting of
train-dev-test splits in five distinct topic groups, based on the popular
WikiSQL and WikiTableQuestions datasets. We empirically show that, despite
pre-training on large open-domain text, performance of models degrades

T3QA (Topic Transferable Table Question Answering) a pragmatic adaptation

then utilized to maximize the system's capability of pulling together similar

<span><p>Automatic translation systems are known to struggle with rare words. Among
these, named entities (NEs) and domain-specific terms are crucial, since errors
in their translation can lead to severe meaning distortions. Despite their
importance, previous speech translation (ST) studies have neglected them, also
due to the dearth of publicly available resources tailored to their specific
evaluation. To fill this gap, we i) present the first systematic analysis of
the behavior of state-of-the-art ST systems in translating NEs and terminology,
and ii) release NEuRoparl-ST, a novel benchmark built from European Parliament
speeches annotated with NEs and terminology. Our experiments on the three
language directions covered by our benchmark (en-&gt;es/fr/it) show that ST
systems correctly translate 75-80% of terms and 65-70% of NEs, with very low
performance (37-40%) on person names.

now a variety of benchmarks, such as GLUE, to help improve the development of
such models for natural language understanding. However, little is known about
how well such models work on textual artifacts about code, and we are unaware

<span><p>Open Information Extraction (OIE) is the task of extracting facts from
sentences in the form of relations and their corresponding arguments in
schema-free manner. Intrinsic performance of OIE systems is difficult to
measure due to the incompleteness of existing OIE benchmarks: the ground truth
extractions do not group all acceptable surface realizations of the same fact
that can be extracted from a sentence. To measure performance of OIE systems
more realistically, it is necessary to manually annotate complete facts (i.e.,
clusters of all acceptable surface realizations of the same fact) from input
sentences. We propose AnnIE: an interactive annotation platform that
facilitates such challenging annotation tasks and supports creation of complete
fact-oriented OIE evaluation benchmarks. AnnIE is modular and flexible in order
to support different use case scenarios (i.e., benchmarks covering different
types of facts). We use AnnIE to build two complete OIE benchmarks: one with
verb-mediated facts and another with facts encompassing named entities.
Finally, we evaluate several OIE systems on our complete benchmarks created
with AnnIE. Our results suggest that existing incomplete benchmarks are overly
lenient, and that OIE systems are not as robust as previously reported. We

<span><p>Multimodal program synthesis, which leverages different types of user input
to synthesize a desired program, is an attractive way to scale program
synthesis to challenging settings; however, it requires integrating noisy
signals from the user, like natural language, with hard constraints on the
program's behavior. This paper proposes an optimal neural synthesis approach
where the goal is to find a program that satisfies user-provided constraints
while also maximizing the program's score with respect to a neural model.
Specifically, we focus on multimodal synthesis tasks in which the user intent
is expressed using a combination of natural language (NL) and input-output
examples. At the core of our method is a top-down recurrent neural model that
places distributions over abstract syntax trees conditioned on the NL input.
This model not only allows for efficient search over the space of syntactically
valid programs, but it allows us to leverage automated program analysis
techniques for pruning the search space based on infeasibility of partial
programs with respect to the user's constraints. The experimental results on a
multimodal synthesis dataset (StructuredRegex) show that our method
substantially outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms of
accuracy and efficiency, and finds model-optimal programs more frequently.

performance of deep learning models in various natural language processing

solved by alternating gradient descent/ascent algorithms. Such a formulation
treats the adversarial and the defending players equally, which is undesirable
because only the defending player contributes to the generalization
performance. To address this issue, we propose Stackelberg Adversarial
Regularization (SALT), which formulates adversarial regularization as a
Stackelberg game. This formulation induces a competition between a leader and a
follower, where the follower generates perturbations, and the leader trains the
model subject to the perturbations. Different from conventional approaches, in
SALT, the leader is in an advantageous position. When the leader moves, it
recognizes the strategy of the follower and takes the anticipated follower's
outcomes into consideration. Such a leader's advantage enables us to improve
the model fitting to the unperturbed data. The leader's strategic information
is captured by the Stackelberg gradient, which is obtained using an unrolling

<span><p>An effective recipe for building seq2seq, non-autoregressive, task-oriented
parsers to map utterances to semantic frames proceeds in three steps: encoding
an utterance $x$, predicting a frame's length |y|, and decoding a |y|-sized
frame with utterance and ontology tokens. Though empirically strong, these
models are typically bottlenecked by length prediction, as even small
inaccuracies change the syntactic and semantic characteristics of resulting
frames. In our work, we propose span pointer networks, non-autoregressive
parsers which shift the decoding task from text generation to span prediction;
that is, when imputing utterance spans into frame slots, our model produces
endpoints (e.g., [i, j]) as opposed to text (e.g., "6pm"). This natural
quantization of the output space reduces the variability of gold frames,
therefore improving length prediction and, ultimately, exact match.
Furthermore, length prediction is now responsible for frame syntax and the
decoder is responsible for frame semantics, resulting in a coarse-to-fine
model. We evaluate our approach on several task-oriented semantic parsing
datasets. Notably, we bridge the quality gap between non-autogressive and
autoregressive parsers, achieving 87 EM on TOPv2 (Chen et al. 2020).
Furthermore, due to our more consistent gold frames, we show strong
improvements in model generalization in both cross-domain and cross-lingual

CLIPScore, with its tight focus on image-text compatibility, is complementary

Thus, we also present a reference-augmented version, RefCLIPScore, which
achieves even higher correlation. Beyond literal description tasks, several

alt-text rating), but also where it is relatively weaker in comparison to

<span><p>To diversify and enrich generated dialogue responses, knowledge-grounded
dialogue has been investigated in recent years. The existing methods tackle the
knowledge grounding challenge by retrieving the relevant sentences over a large

their success, however, the existing works have drawbacks on the inference
efficiency. This paper proposes KnowExpert, an end-to-end framework to bypass
the explicit retrieval process and inject knowledge into the pre-trained
language models with lightweight adapters and adapt to the knowledge-grounded
dialogue task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to
tackle this challenge without retrieval in this task under an open-domain

comparably with some retrieval-based baselines while being time-efficient in

<span><p>When language models process syntactically complex sentences, do they use
their representations of syntax in a manner that is consistent with the grammar
of the language? We propose AlterRep, an intervention-based method to address
this question. For any linguistic feature of a given sentence, AlterRep
generates counterfactual representations by altering how the feature is
encoded, while leaving intact all other aspects of the original representation.
By measuring the change in a model's word prediction behavior when these
counterfactual representations are substituted for the original ones, we can
draw conclusions about the causal effect of the linguistic feature in question
on the model's behavior. We apply this method to study how BERT models of
different sizes process relative clauses (RCs). We find that BERT variants use
RC boundary information during word prediction in a manner that is consistent
with the rules of English grammar; this RC boundary information generalizes to
a considerable extent across different RC types, suggesting that BERT
represents RCs as an abstract linguistic category.

few-class classification tasks such as sentiment classification and natural

cumbersome and fallible. For those auto-generated prompts, it is also expensive

Hence, it is still challenging for prompt tuning to address many-class

for many-class text classification and apply logic rules to construct prompts
with several sub-prompts. In this way, PTR is able to encode prior knowledge of
each class into prompt tuning. We conduct experiments on relation

shapes. If a human requests an object based on any of its basic properties,
such as color, shape, or texture, robots should perform the necessary
exploration to accomplish the task. In particular, while substantial effort and
progress has been made on understanding explicitly visual attributes like color

language about shapes and contours. In this work, we introduce a novel
reasoning task that targets both visual and non-visual language about 3D

a natural language description. We introduce several CLIP-based models for

is still the case that these image-based models are weaker at understanding the
3D nature of objects -- properties which play a key role in manipulation. We
find that adding view estimation to language grounding models improves accuracy

the monolingual retrieval task, because of the same lexical inputs, it is
easier for model to identify the query terms that occurred in documents.
However, in the multilingual pretrained models that the words in different

query terms into related terms, i.e., terms that appear in a similar context,
in addition to or sometimes rather than synonyms in the target language. This
property is creating difficulties for the model to connect terms that cooccur

presents a chicken and egg problem: if the shape bias must be present in the

first place? In this paper, we propose that communicative efficiency explains
both how the shape bias emerged and why it persists across generations. We
model this process with neural emergent language agents that learn to

Second, we show that pressure brought on by communicative need is also

classification exhibit unique features: 1) the classification result of a

granularity; 2) proposals contain multiple types of documents; 3) domain
experts can empirically provide partial labels that can be leveraged to improve
task performances. In this paper, we focus on developing a new deep proposal

use the embedding of these empirical partial labels to initialize the state of
neural networks. Our model can automatically identify the best length of label
sequence to stop next label prediction. Finally, we present extensive results

between narratives and proverbs, ensuring that models need to go beyond
surface-level reasoning to succeed. We explore three tasks: (1) proverb
recommendation and alignment prediction, (2) narrative generation for a given
proverb and topic, and (3) identifying narratives with similar motifs. Our
experiments show that neural language models struggle in our tasks compared to
humans, and the tasks pose multiple learning challenges.

<span><p>Deep learning-based Natural Language Processing methods, especially
transformers, have achieved impressive performance in the last few years.
Applying those state-of-the-art NLP methods to legal activities to automate or
simplify some simple work is of great value. This work investigates the value
of domain adaptive pre-training and language adapters in legal NLP tasks. By
comparing the performance of language models with domain adaptive pre-training
on different tasks and different dataset splits, we show that domain adaptive
pre-training is only helpful with low-resource downstream tasks, thus far from
being a panacea. We also benchmark the performance of adapters in a typical
legal NLP task and show that they can yield similar performance to full model
tuning with much smaller training costs. As an additional result, we release
LegalRoBERTa, a RoBERTa model further pre-trained on legal corpora.
