<span><p>We study Comparative Preference Classification (CPC) which aims at predicting
whether a preference comparison exists between two entities in a given sentence
and, if so, which entity is preferred over the other. High-quality CPC models
can significantly benefit applications such as comparative question answering
and review-based recommendations. Among the existing approaches, non-deep
learning methods suffer from inferior performances. The state-of-the-art graph
neural network-based ED-GAT (Ma et al., 2020) only considers syntactic
information while ignoring the critical semantic relations and the sentiments
to the compared entities. We proposed sentiment Analysis Enhanced COmparative
Network (SAECON) which improves CPC ac-curacy with a sentiment analyzer that
learns sentiments to individual entities via domain adaptive knowledge
transfer. Experiments on the CompSent-19 (Panchenko et al., 2019) dataset
present a significant improvement on the F1 scores over the best existing CPC
approaches.

<span><p>Cyber intelligence is widely and abundantly available in numerous open online
sources with reports on vulnerabilities and incidents. This constant stream of
noisy information requires new tools and techniques if it is to be used for the
benefit of analysts and investigators in various organizations. In this paper
we present and implement a novel knowledge graph and knowledge mining framework
for extracting relevant information from free-form text about incidents in the
cyber domain. Our framework includes a machine learning based pipeline as well
as crawling methods for generating graphs of entities, attackers and the
related information with our non-technical cyber ontology. We test our
framework on publicly available cyber incident datasets to evaluate the
accuracy of our knowledge mining methods as well as the usefulness of the
framework in the use of cyber analysts. Our results show analyzing the
knowledge graph constructed using the novel framework, an analyst can infer
additional information from the current cyber landscape in terms of risk to
various entities and the propagation of risk between industries and countries.
Expanding the framework to accommodate more technical and operational level
information can increase the accuracy and explainability of trends and risk in
the knowledge graph.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03853">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Pimentel et al. (2020) recently analysed probing from an
information-theoretic perspective. They argue that probing should be seen as
approximating a mutual information. This led to the rather unintuitive
conclusion that representations encode exactly the same information about a
target task as the original sentences. The mutual information, however, assumes
the true probability distribution of a pair of random variables is known,
leading to unintuitive results in settings where it is not. This paper proposes
a new framework to measure what we term Bayesian mutual information, which
analyses information from the perspective of Bayesian agents -- allowing for
more intuitive findings in scenarios with finite data. For instance, under
Bayesian MI we have that data can add information, processing can help, and
information can hurt, which makes it more intuitive for machine learning
applications. Finally, we apply our framework to probing where we believe
Bayesian mutual information naturally operationalises ease of extraction by
explicitly limiting the available background knowledge to solve a task.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03858">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recent works have found evidence of gender bias in models of machine
translation and coreference resolution using mostly synthetic diagnostic
datasets. While these quantify bias in a controlled experiment, they often do
so on a small scale and consist mostly of artificial, out-of-distribution
sentences. In this work, we find grammatical patterns indicating stereotypical
and non-stereotypical gender-role assignments (e.g., female nurses versus male
dancers) in corpora from three domains, resulting in a first large-scale gender
bias dataset of 108K diverse real-world English sentences. We manually verify
the quality of our corpus and use it to evaluate gender bias in various
coreference resolution and machine translation models. We find that all tested
models tend to over-rely on gender stereotypes when presented with natural
inputs, which may be especially harmful when deployed in commercial systems.
Finally, we show that our dataset lends itself to finetuning a coreference
resolution model, finding it mitigates bias on a held out set. Our dataset and
models are publicly available at www.github.com/SLAB-NLP/BUG. We hope they will
spur future research into gender bias evaluation mitigation techniques in
realistic settings.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03888">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of
NLP tasks including summarization. Training and inference using large
transformer models can be computationally expensive. Previous work has focused
on one important bottleneck, the quadratic self-attention mechanism in the
encoder. Modified encoder architectures such as LED or LoBART use local
attention patterns to address this problem for summarization. In contrast, this
work focuses on the transformer's encoder-decoder attention mechanism. The cost
of this attention becomes more significant in inference or training approaches
that require model-generated histories. First, we examine the complexity of the
encoder-decoder attention. We demonstrate empirically that there is a sparse
sentence structure in document summarization that can be exploited by
constraining the attention mechanism to a subset of input sentences, whilst
maintaining system performance. Second, we propose a modified architecture that
selects the subset of sentences to constrain the encoder-decoder attention.
Experiments are carried out on abstractive summarization tasks, including
CNN/DailyMail, XSum, Spotify Podcast, and arXiv.

<span><p>We introduce ELIT, the Emory Language and Information Toolkit, which is a
comprehensive NLP framework providing transformer-based end-to-end models for
core tasks with a special focus on memory efficiency while maintaining
state-of-the-art accuracy and speed. Compared to existing toolkits, ELIT
features an efficient Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model with many downstream
tasks that include lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity
recognition, dependency parsing, constituency parsing, semantic role labeling,
and AMR parsing. The backbone of ELIT's MTL framework is a pre-trained
transformer encoder that is shared across tasks to speed up their inference.
ELIT provides pre-trained models developed on a remix of eight datasets. To
scale up its service, ELIT also integrates a RESTful Client/Server combination.
On the server side, ELIT extends its functionality to cover other tasks such as
tokenization and coreference resolution, providing an end user with agile
research experience. All resources including the source codes, documentation,

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Representation of linguistic phenomena in computational language models is
typically assessed against the predictions of existing linguistic theories of
these phenomena. Using the notion of polarity as a case study, we show that
this is not always the most adequate set-up. We probe polarity via so-called
'negative polarity items' (in particular, English 'any') in two pre-trained
Transformer-based models (BERT and GPT-2). We show that -- at least for
polarity -- metrics derived from language models are more consistent with data
from psycholinguistic experiments than linguistic theory predictions.
Establishing this allows us to more adequately evaluate the performance of
language models and also to use language models to discover new insights into
natural language grammar beyond existing linguistic theories. Overall, our
results encourage a closer tie between experiments with human subjects and with
language models. We propose methods to enable this closer tie, with language
models as part of experimental pipeline, and show this pipeline at work.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>While recent research on natural language inference has considerably
benefited from large annotated datasets, the amount of inference-related
knowledge (including commonsense) provided in the annotated data is still

further address the limitation: (1) unsupervised pretraining can leverage
knowledge in much larger unstructured text data; (2) structured (often
human-curated) knowledge has started to be considered in neural-network-based
models for NLI. An immediate question is whether these two approaches
complement each other, or how to develop models that can bring together their
advantages. In this paper, we propose models that leverage structured knowledge

<span><p>Transformers have recently become very popular for sequence-to-sequence

we propose a multi-task learning-based transformer model for low-resource

consists of a conformer [1] encoder and two parallel transformer decoders. We
use a phoneme decoder (PHN-DEC) for the phoneme recognition task and a grapheme
decoder (GRP-DEC) to predict grapheme sequence. We consider the phoneme
recognition task as an auxiliary task for our multi-task learning framework. We
jointly optimize the network for both phoneme and grapheme recognition tasks
using Joint CTC-Attention [2] training. We use a conditional decoding scheme to
inject the language information into the model before predicting the grapheme

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Currently, multilingual machine translation is receiving more and more
attention since it brings better performance for low resource languages (LRLs)
and saves more space. However, existing multilingual machine translation models
face a severe challenge: imbalance. As a result, the translation performance of
different languages in multilingual translation models are quite different. We
argue that this imbalance problem stems from the different learning
competencies of different languages. Therefore, we focus on balancing the
learning competencies of different languages and propose Competence-based
Curriculum Learning for Multilingual Machine Translation, named CCL-M.
Specifically, we firstly define two competencies to help schedule the high
resource languages (HRLs) and the low resource languages: 1) Self-evaluated
Competence, evaluating how well the language itself has been learned; and 2)
HRLs-evaluated Competence, evaluating whether an LRL is ready to be learned
according to HRLs' Self-evaluated Competence. Based on the above competencies,
we utilize the proposed CCL-M algorithm to gradually add new languages into the
training set in a curriculum learning manner. Furthermore, we propose a novel
competenceaware dynamic balancing sampling strategy for better selecting
training samples in multilingual training. Experimental results show that our
approach has achieved a steady and significant performance gain compared to the

<span><p>With the rapid increase in the volume of dialogue data from daily life, there
is a growing demand for dialogue summarization. Unfortunately, training a large
summarization model is generally infeasible due to the inadequacy of dialogue
data with annotated summaries. Most existing works for low-resource dialogue
summarization directly pretrain models in other domains, e.g., the news domain,
but they generally neglect the huge difference between dialogues and
conventional articles. To bridge the gap between out-of-domain pretraining and
in-domain fine-tuning, in this work, we propose a multi-source pretraining
paradigm to better leverage the external summary data. Specifically, we exploit
large-scale in-domain non-summary data to separately pretrain the dialogue
encoder and the summary decoder. The combined encoder-decoder model is then
pretrained on the out-of-domain summary data using adversarial critics, aiming
to facilitate domain-agnostic summarization. The experimental results on two
public datasets show that with only limited training data, our approach
achieves competitive performance and generalizes well in different dialogue
scenarios.

<span><p>Human dialogue contains evolving concepts, and speakers naturally associate
multiple concepts to compose a response. However, current dialogue models with
the seq2seq framework lack the ability to effectively manage concept
transitions and can hardly introduce multiple concepts to responses in a
sequential decoding manner. To facilitate a controllable and coherent dialogue,
in this work, we devise a concept-guided non-autoregressive model (CG-nAR) for

<span><p>Model robustness to bias is often determined by the generalization on

behind such methods is that this also leads to the discovery of more robust

probing-based framework that allows for post-hoc interpretation of biases in

extractability of certain biases from the model's representations. We

we propose a novel three-stage learning framework based on weakly supervised

<span><p>Abstractive text summarization is one of the areas influenced by the
emergence of pre-trained language models. Current pre-training works in
abstractive summarization give more points to the summaries with more words in
common with the main text and pay less attention to the semantic similarity
between generated sentences and the original document. We propose ARMAN, a
Transformer-based encoder-decoder model pre-trained with three novel objectives
to address this issue. In ARMAN, salient sentences from a document are selected
according to a modified semantic score to be masked and form a pseudo summary.
To summarize more accurately and similar to human writing patterns, we applied
modified sentence reordering. We evaluated our proposed models on six
downstream Persian summarization tasks. Experimental results show that our
proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all six summarization

<span><p>Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning is a crucial task that has gained
increasing research interest in recent years. Most existing methods focus on
reasoning at past timestamps to complete the missing facts, and there are only
a few works of reasoning on known TKGs to forecast future facts. Compared with
the completion task, the forecasting task is more difficult that faces two main
challenges: (1) how to effectively model the time information to handle future
timestamps? (2) how to make inductive inference to handle previously unseen
entities that emerge over time? To address these challenges, we propose the
first reinforcement learning method for forecasting. Specifically, the agent
travels on historical knowledge graph snapshots to search for the answer. Our
method defines a relative time encoding function to capture the timespan

<span><p>The goal of building intelligent dialogue systems has largely been
\textit{separately} pursued under two paradigms: task-oriented dialogue (TOD)
systems, which perform goal-oriented functions, and open-domain dialogue (ODD)
systems, which focus on non-goal-oriented chitchat. The two dialogue modes can
potentially be intertwined together seamlessly in the same conversation, as
easily done by a friendly human assistant. Such ability is desirable in
conversational agents, as the integration makes them more accessible and
useful. Our paper addresses this problem of fusing TODs and ODDs in multi-turn
dialogues. Based on the popular TOD dataset MultiWOZ, we build a new dataset
FusedChat, by rewriting the existing TOD turns and adding new ODD turns. This
procedure constructs conversation sessions containing exchanges from both
dialogue modes. It features inter-mode contextual dependency, i.e., the
dialogue turns from the two modes depend on each other. Rich dependency
patterns including co-reference and ellipsis are features. The new dataset,
with 60k new human-written ODD turns and 5k re-written TOD turns, offers a
benchmark to test a dialogue model's ability to perform inter-mode
conversations. This is a more challenging task since the model has to determine
the appropriate dialogue mode and generate the response based on the inter-mode
context. But such models would better mimic human-level conversation
capabilities. We evaluate baseline models on this task, including
\textit{classification-based} two-stage models and \textit{two-in-one} fused
models. We publicly release FusedChat and the baselines to propel future work

advantages on low data regimes, finetuned prompt-based models for sentence pair
classification tasks still suffer from a common pitfall of adopting inference
heuristics based on lexical overlap, e.g., models incorrectly assuming a
sentence pair is of the same meaning because they consist of the same set of
words. Interestingly, we find that this particular inference heuristic is
significantly less present in the zero-shot evaluation of the prompt-based
model, indicating how finetuning can be destructive to useful knowledge learned

promising improvements on the three corresponding challenge datasets used to

Besides, those works either cannot embed knowledge context dynamically

<span><p>Opinion summarization has been traditionally approached with unsupervised,
weakly-supervised and few-shot learning techniques. In this work, we collect a
large dataset of summaries paired with user reviews for over 31,000 products,
enabling supervised training. However, the number of reviews per product is
large (320 on average), making summarization - and especially training a
summarizer - impractical. Moreover, the content of many reviews is not
reflected in the human-written summaries, and, thus, the summarizer trained on
random review subsets hallucinates. In order to deal with both of these
challenges, we formulate the task as jointly learning to select informative
subsets of reviews and summarizing the opinions expressed in these subsets. The
choice of the review subset is treated as a latent variable, predicted by a
small and simple selector. The subset is then fed into a more powerful
summarizer. For joint training, we use amortized variational inference and
policy gradient methods. Our experiments demonstrate the importance of
selecting informative reviews resulting in improved quality of summaries and
reduced hallucinations.

<span><p>Prompts for pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable
performance by bridging the gap between pre-training tasks and various
downstream tasks. Among these methods, prompt tuning, which freezes PLMs and
only tunes soft prompts, provides an efficient and effective solution for
adapting large-scale PLMs to downstream tasks. However, prompt tuning is yet to
be fully explored. In our pilot experiments, we find that prompt tuning
performs comparably with conventional full-model fine-tuning when downstream
data are sufficient, whereas it performs much worse under few-shot learning
settings, which may hinder the application of prompt tuning in practice. We
attribute this low performance to the manner of initializing soft prompts.
Therefore, in this work, we propose to pre-train prompts by adding soft prompts
into the pre-training stage to obtain a better initialization. We name this
Pre-trained Prompt Tuning framework "PPT". To ensure the generalization of PPT,
we formulate similar classification tasks into a unified task form and
pre-train soft prompts for this unified task. Extensive experiments show that
tuning pre-trained prompts for downstream tasks can reach or even outperform
full-model fine-tuning under both full-data and few-shot settings. Our approach
is effective and efficient for using large-scale PLMs in practice.

<span><p>The ability to identify and resolve uncertainty is crucial for the robustness
of a dialogue system. Indeed, this has been confirmed empirically on systems
that utilise Bayesian approaches to dialogue belief tracking. However, such
systems consider only confidence estimates and have difficulty scaling to more
complex settings. Neural dialogue systems, on the other hand, rarely take
uncertainties into account. They are therefore overconfident in their decisions
and less robust. Moreover, the performance of the tracking task is often
evaluated in isolation, without consideration of its effect on the downstream
policy optimisation. We propose the use of different uncertainty measures in
neural belief tracking. The effects of these measures on the downstream task of
policy optimisation are evaluated by adding selected measures of uncertainty to
the feature space of the policy and training policies through interaction with
a user simulator. Both human and simulated user results show that incorporating
these measures leads to improvements both of the performance and of the
robustness of the downstream dialogue policy. This highlights the importance of
developing neural dialogue belief trackers that take uncertainty into account.

<span><p>Recently, the textual adversarial attack models become increasingly popular
due to their successful in estimating the robustness of NLP models. However,
existing works have obvious deficiencies. (1) They usually consider only a
single granularity of modification strategies (e.g. word-level or
sentence-level), which is insufficient to explore the holistic textual space
for generation; (2) They need to query victim models hundreds of times to make
a successful attack, which is highly inefficient in practice. To address such
problems, in this paper we propose MAYA, a Multi-grAnularitY Attack model to
effectively generate high-quality adversarial samples with fewer queries to
victim models. Furthermore, we propose a reinforcement-learning based method to
train a multi-granularity attack agent through behavior cloning with the expert
knowledge from our MAYA algorithm to further reduce the query times.
Additionally, we also adapt the agent to attack black-box models that only
output labels without confidence scores. We conduct comprehensive experiments
to evaluate our attack models by attacking BiLSTM, BERT and RoBERTa in two
different black-box attack settings and three benchmark datasets. Experimental
results show that our models achieve overall better attacking performance and
produce more fluent and grammatical adversarial samples compared to baseline

<span><p>Contrastive learning has been attracting much attention for learning
unsupervised sentence embeddings. The current state-of-the-art unsupervised
method is the unsupervised SimCSE (unsup-SimCSE). Unsup-SimCSE takes dropout as
a minimal data augmentation method, and passes the same input sentence to a
pre-trained Transformer encoder (with dropout turned on) twice to obtain the
two corresponding embeddings to build a positive pair. As the length
information of a sentence will generally be encoded into the sentence
embeddings due to the usage of position embedding in Transformer, each positive
pair in unsup-SimCSE actually contains the same length information. And thus
unsup-SimCSE trained with these positive pairs is probably biased, which would
tend to consider that sentences of the same or similar length are more similar
in semantics. Through statistical observations, we find that unsup-SimCSE does
have such a problem. To alleviate it, we apply a simple repetition operation to
modify the input sentence, and then pass the input sentence and its modified
counterpart to the pre-trained Transformer encoder, respectively, to get the
positive pair. Additionally, we draw inspiration from the community of computer
vision and introduce a momentum contrast, enlarging the number of negative
pairs without additional calculations. The proposed two modifications are
applied on positive and negative pairs separately, and build a new sentence
embedding method, termed Enhanced Unsup-SimCSE (ESimCSE). We evaluate the
proposed ESimCSE on several benchmark datasets w.r.t the semantic text
similarity (STS) task. Experimental results show that ESimCSE outperforms the
state-of-the-art unsup-SimCSE by an average Spearman correlation of 2.02% on

constraints to uphold such criteria may render attacks unsuccessful, raising
the question of whether valid attacks are actually feasible. In this work, we
investigate this through the lens of human language ability. We report on
crowdsourcing studies in which we task humans with iteratively modifying words
in an input text, while receiving immediate model feedback, with the aim of
causing a sentiment classification model to misclassify the example. Our
findings suggest that humans are capable of generating a substantial amount of
adversarial examples using semantics-preserving word substitutions. We analyze
how human-generated adversarial examples compare to the recently proposed
TextFooler, Genetic, BAE and SememePSO attack algorithms on the dimensions
naturalness, preservation of sentiment, grammaticality and substitution rate.
Our findings suggest that human-generated adversarial examples are not more

<span><p>In cross-lingual text classification, it is required that task-specific
training data in high-resource source languages are available, where the task
is identical to that of a low-resource target language. However, collecting
such training data can be infeasible because of the labeling cost, task
characteristics, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes an alternative
solution that uses only task-independent word embeddings of high-resource
languages and bilingual dictionaries. First, we construct a dictionary-based
heterogeneous graph (DHG) from bilingual dictionaries. This opens the
possibility to use graph neural networks for cross-lingual transfer. The
remaining challenge is the heterogeneity of DHG because multiple languages are
considered. To address this challenge, we propose dictionary-based
heterogeneous graph neural network (DHGNet) that effectively handles the
heterogeneity of DHG by two-step aggregations, which are word-level and
language-level aggregations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms pretrained models even though it does not access to large corpora.
Furthermore, it can perform well even though dictionaries contain many
incorrect translations. Its robustness allows the usage of a wider range of
dictionaries such as an automatically constructed dictionary and crowdsourced
dictionary, which are convenient for real-world applications.

Recently, these measures have been applied to embeddings from contextualized

informativity of such measures for contextualized language models. We find that
a small number of rogue dimensions, often just 1-3, dominate these measures.
Moreover, we find a striking mismatch between the dimensions that dominate
similarity measures and those which are important to the behavior of the model.
We show that simple postprocessing techniques such as standardization are able

<span><p>This article describes an efficient end-to-end speech translation (E2E-ST)
framework based on non-autoregressive (NAR) models. End-to-end speech
translation models have several advantages over traditional cascade systems
such as inference latency reduction. However, conventional AR decoding methods
are not fast enough because each token is generated incrementally. NAR models,
however, can accelerate the decoding speed by generating multiple tokens in
parallel on the basis of the token-wise conditional independence assumption. We
propose a unified NAR E2E-ST framework called Orthros, which has an NAR decoder
and an auxiliary shallow AR decoder on top of the shared encoder. The auxiliary
shallow AR decoder selects the best hypothesis by rescoring multiple candidates
generated from the NAR decoder in parallel (parallel AR rescoring). We adopt
conditional masked language model (CMLM) and a connectionist temporal
classification (CTC)-based model as NAR decoders for Orthros, referred to as
Orthros-CMLM and Orthros-CTC, respectively. We also propose two training
methods to enhance the CMLM decoder. Experimental evaluations on three
benchmark datasets with six language directions demonstrated that Orthros
achieved large improvements in translation quality with a very small overhead
compared with the baseline NAR model. Moreover, the Conformer encoder
architecture enabled large quality improvements, especially for CTC-based

3.63x on CPU with translation quality comparable to that of an AR model.

Existing datasets are limited to providing the degree of idiomaticity of

that, on the task of detecting idiomatic usage, these models perform reasonably

both high and low quality BT data by providing hints (as source tags on the

predicting whether a source token needs to be translated or transliterated to
the target language, which is common in cross-script translation tasks (i.e.,
where source and target do not share the written script). For such cases, we
propose training the model with additional hints (as target tags on the

<span><p>A key challenge in training neural networks for a given medical imaging task
is often the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of manually labeled
examples. In contrast, textual imaging reports, which are often readily
available in medical records, contain rich but unstructured interpretations
written by experts as part of standard clinical practice. We propose using
these textual reports as a form of weak supervision to improve the image
interpretation performance of a neural network without requiring additional
manually labeled examples. We use an image-text matching task to train a
feature extractor and then fine-tune it in a transfer learning setting for a
supervised task using a small labeled dataset. The end result is a neural
network that automatically interprets imagery without requiring textual reports
during inference. This approach can be applied to any task for which text-image
pairs are readily available. We evaluate our method on three classification
tasks and find consistent performance improvements, reducing the need for
labeled data by 67%-98%.

<span><p>There is an increasing interest in the use of mathematical word problem (MWP)
generation in educational assessment. Different from standard natural question
generation, MWP generation needs to maintain the underlying mathematical
operations between quantities and variables, while at the same time ensuring
the relevance between the output and the given topic. To address above problem,
we develop an end-to-end neural model to generate diverse MWPs in real-world
scenarios from commonsense knowledge graph and equations. The proposed model
(1) learns both representations from edge-enhanced Levi graphs of symbolic
equations and commonsense knowledge; (2) automatically fuses equation and
commonsense knowledge information via a self-planning module when generating
the MWPs. Experiments on an educational gold-standard set and a large-scale
generated MWP set show that our approach is superior on the MWP generation
task, and it outperforms the SOTA models in terms of both automatic evaluation

equation relevance, topic relevance, and language coherence. To encourage

<span><p>Although neural sequence-to-sequence models have been successfully applied to
semantic parsing, they fail at compositional generalization, i.e., they are

Motivated by traditional semantic parsing where compositionality is explicitly
accounted for by symbolic grammars, we propose a new decoding framework that
preserves the expressivity and generality of sequence-to-sequence models while
featuring lexicon-style alignments and disentangled information processing.
Specifically, we decompose decoding into two phases where an input utterance is
first tagged with semantic symbols representing the meaning of individual
words, and then a sequence-to-sequence model is used to predict the final
meaning representation conditioning on the utterance and the predicted tag
sequence. Experimental results on three semantic parsing datasets show that the

the users' utterances to such distributions. Learning such a mapping poses new

build a new dataset named NUANCED that focuses on such realistic settings for

<span><p>When trained on large, unfiltered crawls from the internet, language models
pick up and reproduce all kinds of undesirable biases that can be found in the

As large models require millions of training examples to achieve good
performance, it is difficult to completely prevent them from being exposed to
such content. In this paper, we first demonstrate a surprising finding:
pretrained language models recognize, to a considerable degree, their
undesirable biases and the toxicity of the content they produce. We refer to
this capability as self-diagnosis. Based on this finding, we then propose a
decoding algorithm that, given only a textual description of the undesired
behavior, reduces the probability of a language model producing problematic

on manually curated word lists, nor does it require any training data or

often rely on a retrieval model to identify relevant information for reasoning.
The retrieval model is typically trained to maximize the likelihood of the

evidence candidates. Moreover, not all such candidates are labeled as positive
during annotation, rendering the training signal weak and noisy. This problem
is exacerbated when the questions are unanswerable or when the answers are
Boolean, since the model cannot rely on lexical overlap to make a connection

marginalizing over this set during training allows a model to mitigate false

Reordering a narrative can impact the temporal, causal, event-based, and other

its interpretation and interestingness. In this paper, we propose and

an appropriate prompt template requires domain expertise, and it is cumbersome

fine-tuning. We report huge gains over off-the-shelf MLMs with Mirror-BERT in
both lexical-level and sentence-level tasks, across different domains and

(STS) tasks, our self-supervised Mirror-BERT model even matches the performance
of the task-tuned Sentence-BERT models from prior work. Finally, we delve

method which can be used to edit this knowledge and, thus, fix 'bugs' or
unexpected predictions without the need for expensive re-training or

In our approach, we train a hyper-network with constrained optimization to

KnowledgeEditor's efficacy with two popular architectures and
knowledge-intensive tasks: i) a BERT model fine-tuned for fact-checking, and
ii) a sequence-to-sequence BART model for question answering. With our method,
changing a prediction on the specific wording of a query tends to result in a
consistent change in predictions also for its paraphrases. We show that this

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07843">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-supervised learning framework for
end-to-end speech separation. The proposed method first uses mixtures of
unseparated sources and the mixture invariant training (MixIT) criterion to
train a teacher model. The teacher model then estimates separated sources that
are used to train a student model with standard permutation invariant training
(PIT). The student model can be fine-tuned with supervised data, i.e., paired
artificial mixtures and clean speech sources, and further improved via model
distillation. Experiments with single and multi channel mixtures show that the
teacher-student training resolves the over-separation problem observed in the
original MixIT method. Further, the semisupervised performance is comparable to
a fully-supervised separation system trained using ten times the amount of
supervised data.

<span><p>In this work, we present to the NLP community, and to the wider research
community as a whole, an application for the diachronic analysis of research
corpora. We open source an easy-to-use tool coined: DRIFT, which allows
researchers to track research trends and development over the years. The
analysis methods are collated from well-cited research works, with a few of our
own methods added for good measure. Succinctly put, some of the analysis
methods are: keyword extraction, word clouds, predicting
declining/stagnant/growing trends using Productivity, tracking bi-grams using
Acceleration plots, finding the Semantic Drift of words, tracking trends using
similarity, etc. To demonstrate the utility and efficacy of our tool, we
perform a case study on the cs.CL corpus of the arXiv repository and draw
inferences from the analysis methods. The toolkit and the associated code are

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04556">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Code representation learning, which aims to encode the semantics of source
code into distributed vectors, plays an important role in recent
deep-learning-based models for code intelligence. Recently, many pre-trained
language models for source code (e.g., CuBERT and CodeBERT) have been proposed
to model the context of code and serve as a basis for downstream code
intelligence tasks such as code search, code clone detection, and program
translation. Current approaches typically consider the source code as a plain
sequence of tokens, or inject the structure information (e.g., AST and
data-flow) into the sequential model pre-training. To further explore the
properties of programming languages, this paper proposes SynCoBERT, a
syntax-guided multi-modal contrastive pre-training approach for better code
representations. Specially, we design two novel pre-training objectives
originating from the symbolic and syntactic properties of source code, i.e.,
Identifier Prediction (IP) and AST Edge Prediction (TEP), which are designed to
predict identifiers, and edges between two nodes of AST, respectively.
Meanwhile, to exploit the complementary information in semantically equivalent
modalities (i.e., code, comment, AST) of the code, we propose a multi-modal
contrastive learning strategy to maximize the mutual information among
different modalities. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks related to
code intelligence show that SynCoBERT advances the state-of-the-art with the
same pre-training corpus and model size.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12202">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In joint entity and relation extraction, existing work either sequentially
encode task-specific features, leading to an imbalance in inter-task feature
interaction where features extracted later have no direct contact with those
that come first. Or they encode entity features and relation features in a
parallel manner, meaning that feature representation learning for each task is
largely independent of each other except for input sharing. We propose a
partition filter network to model two-way interaction between tasks properly,
where feature encoding is decomposed into two steps: partition and filter. In
our encoder, we leverage two gates: entity and relation gate, to segment
neurons into two task partitions and one shared partition. The shared partition
represents inter-task information valuable to both tasks and is evenly shared
across two tasks to ensure proper two-way interaction. The task partitions
represent intra-task information and are formed through concerted efforts of
both gates, making sure that encoding of task-specific features is dependent
upon each other. Experiment results on six public datasets show that our model
performs significantly better than previous approaches. In addition, contrary
to what previous work has claimed, our auxiliary experiments suggest that
relation prediction is contributory to named entity prediction in a
non-negligible way. The source code can be found at

Wasserstein distance and barycenter. By modelling the layer output of deep
contextualized embeddings as a probability distribution rather than by a vector
embedding; this framework provides a natural way to aggregate the different
outputs through the Wasserstein space topology. In addition, it provides
theoretical grounds to our metric and offers an alternative to available
solutions e.g., MoverScore and BertScore). Numerical evaluation is performed on
four different tasks: machine translation, summarization, data2text generation

In this work, we introduce new pretraining losses tailored to learn

expose the model to code-switched language. To scale up training, we
automatically build a pretraining corpus composed of multilingual conversations
in five different languages (French, Italian, English, German and Spanish) from
\texttt{OpenSubtitles}, a huge multilingual corpus composed of 24.3G tokens. We
test the generic representations on \texttt{MIAM}, a new benchmark composed of
five dialog act corpora on the same aforementioned languages as well as on two
novel multilingual downstream tasks (\textit{i.e} multilingual mask utterance
retrieval and multilingual inconsistency identification). Our experiments show
that our new code switched-inspired losses achieve a better performance in both

<span><p>Extractive text summarization aims at extracting the most representative
sentences from a given document as its summary. To extract a good summary from
a long text document, sentence embedding plays an important role. Recent
studies have leveraged graph neural networks to capture the inter-sentential
relationship (e.g., the discourse graph) to learn contextual sentence
embedding. However, those approaches neither consider multiple types of
inter-sentential relationships (e.g., semantic similarity &amp; natural
connection), nor model intra-sentential relationships (e.g, semantic &amp;
syntactic relationship among words). To address these problems, we propose a
novel Multiplex Graph Convolutional Network (Multi-GCN) to jointly model
different types of relationships among sentences and words. Based on Multi-GCN,
we propose a Multiplex Graph Summarization (Multi-GraS) model for extractive
text summarization. Finally, we evaluate the proposed models on the
CNN/DailyMail benchmark dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<span><p>Most existing NER methods rely on extensive labeled data for model training,
which struggles in the low-resource scenarios with limited training data.
Recently, prompt-tuning methods for pre-trained language models have achieved
remarkable performance in few-shot learning by exploiting prompts as task
guidance to reduce the gap between training progress and downstream tuning.
Inspired by prompt learning, we propose a novel lightweight generative
framework with prompt-guided attention for low-resource NER (LightNER).
Specifically, we construct the semantic-aware answer space of entity categories
for prompt learning to generate the entity span sequence and entity categories
without any label-specific classifiers. We further propose prompt-guided
attention by incorporating continuous prompts into the self-attention layer to
re-modulate the attention and adapt pre-trained weights. Note that we only tune
those continuous prompts with the whole parameter of the pre-trained language
model fixed, thus, making our approach lightweight and flexible for
low-resource scenarios and can better transfer knowledge across domains.
Experimental results show that LightNER can obtain comparable performance in
the standard supervised setting and outperform strong baselines in low-resource
settings by tuning only a small part of the parameters.

<span><p>Multimodal sentiment analysis is a trending area of research, and the
multimodal fusion is one of its most active topic. Acknowledging humans
communicate through a variety of channels (i.e visual, acoustic, linguistic),
multimodal systems aim at integrating different unimodal representations into a
synthetic one. So far, a consequent effort has been made on developing complex
architectures allowing the fusion of these modalities. However, such systems
are mainly trained by minimising simple losses such as $L_1$ or cross-entropy.
In this work, we investigate unexplored penalties and propose a set of new
objectives that measure the dependency between modalities. We demonstrate that
our new penalties lead to a consistent improvement (up to $4.3$ on accuracy)
across a large variety of state-of-the-art models on two well-known sentiment
analysis datasets: \texttt{CMU-MOSI} and \texttt{CMU-MOSEI}. Our method not
only achieves a new SOTA on both datasets but also produces representations
that are more robust to modality drops. Finally, a by-product of our methods
includes a statistical network which can be used to interpret the high
dimensional representations learnt by the model.

a new approach to studying idiolects through a massive cross-author comparison

analogy-based probing task, showing that the learned representations exhibit
surprising regularities that encode qualitative and quantitative shifts of

explore this impact on the syntactic capabilities of RoBERTa, using models
trained on incremental sizes of raw text data. First, we use syntactic
structural probes to determine whether models pretrained on more data encode a
higher amount of syntactic information. Second, we perform a targeted syntactic
evaluation to analyze the impact of pretraining data size on the syntactic
generalization performance of the models. Third, we compare the performance of
the different models on three downstream applications: part-of-speech tagging,
dependency parsing and paraphrase identification. We complement our study with
an analysis of the cost-benefit trade-off of training such models. Our
