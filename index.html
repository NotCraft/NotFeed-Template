<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06232">

<span><p>By the age of two, children tend to assume that new word categories are based
on objects' shape, rather than their color or texture; this assumption is
called the shape bias. They are thought to learn this bias by observing that
their caregiver's language is biased towards shape based categories. This
presents a chicken and egg problem: if the shape bias must be present in the
language in order for children to learn it, how did it arise in language in the
first place? In this paper, we propose that communicative efficiency explains
both how the shape bias emerged and why it persists across generations. We
model this process with neural emergent language agents that learn to
communicate about raw pixelated images. First, we show that the shape bias
emerges as a result of efficient communication strategies employed by agents.
Second, we show that pressure brought on by communicative need is also
necessary for it to persist across generations; simply having a shape bias in
an agent's input language is insufficient. These results suggest that, over and
above the operation of other learning strategies, the shape bias in human
learners may emerge and be sustained by communicative pressures.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06243">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The development of over-parameterized pre-trained language models has made a
significant contribution toward the success of natural language processing.
While over-parameterization of these models is the key to their generalization
power, it makes them unsuitable for deployment on low-capacity devices. We push
the limits of state-of-the-art Transformer-based pre-trained language model
compression using Kronecker decomposition. We use this decomposition for
compression of the embedding layer, all linear mappings in the multi-head
attention, and the feed-forward network modules in the Transformer layer. We
perform intermediate-layer knowledge distillation using the uncompressed model
as the teacher to improve the performance of the compressed model. We present
our KroneckerBERT, a compressed version of the BERT_BASE model obtained using
this framework. We evaluate the performance of KroneckerBERT on well-known NLP
benchmarks and show that for a high compression factor of 19 (5% of the size of
the BERT_BASE model), our KroneckerBERT outperforms state-of-the-art
compression methods on the GLUE. Our experiments indicate that the proposed
model has promising out-of-distribution robustness and is superior to the
state-of-the-art compression methods on SQuAD.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06253">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is known to suffer from a beam-search
problem: after a certain point, increasing beam size causes an overall drop in
translation quality. This effect is especially pronounced for long sentences.
While much work was done analyzing this phenomenon, primarily for
autoregressive NMT models, there is still no consensus on its underlying cause.
In this work, we analyze errors that cause major quality degradation with large
beams in NMT and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We show that a factor that
strongly contributes to the quality degradation with large beams is
\textit{dataset length-bias} - \textit{NMT datasets are strongly biased towards
short sentences}. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new data augmentation
technique -- \textit{Multi-Sentence Resampling (MSR)}. This technique extends
the training examples by concatenating several sentences from the original
dataset to make a long training example. We demonstrate that MSR significantly
reduces degradation with growing beam size and improves final translation
quality on the IWSTL$15$ En-Vi, IWSTL$17$ En-Fr, and WMT$14$ En-De datasets.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Despite the increasing number of large and comprehensive machine translation

restrained by the lack of high-quality parallel corpora as well as engagement
with the people that speak these languages. In this study, we present an
evaluation of state-of-the-art approaches to training and evaluating MT systems
in 22 languages from the Turkic language family, most of which being extremely
under-explored. First, we adopt the TIL Corpus with a few key improvements to
the training and the evaluation sets. Then, we train 26 bilingual baselines as
well as a multi-way neural MT (MNMT) model using the corpus and perform an
extensive analysis using automatic metrics as well as human evaluations. We
find that the MNMT model outperforms almost all bilingual baselines in the
out-of-domain test sets and finetuning the model on a downstream task of a
single pair also results in a huge performance boost in both low- and
high-resource scenarios. Our attentive analysis of evaluation criteria for MT
models in Turkic languages also points to the necessity for further research in
this direction. We release the corpus splits, test sets as well as models to

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In this paper, we propose a novel method based on character
sequence-to-sequence models to correct documents already processed with Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) systems. The main contribution of this paper is a
set of strategies to accurately process strings much longer than the ones used
to train the sequence model while being sample- and resource-efficient,
supported by thorough experimentation. The strategy with the best performance
involves splitting the input document in character n-grams and combining their
individual corrections into the final output using a voting scheme that is
equivalent to an ensemble of a large number of sequence models. We further
investigate how to weigh the contributions from each one of the members of this
ensemble. We test our method on nine languages of the ICDAR 2019 competition on
post-OCR text correction and achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in five
of them. Our code for post-OCR correction is shared at

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06270">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Despite their recent successes in tackling many NLP tasks, large-scale
pre-trained language models do not perform as well in few-shot settings where
only a handful of training examples are available. To address this shortcoming,
we propose STraTA, which stands for Self-Training with Task Augmentation, an
approach that builds on two key ideas for effective leverage of unlabeled data.
First, STraTA uses task augmentation, a novel technique that synthesizes a
large amount of data for auxiliary-task fine-tuning from target-task unlabeled
texts. Second, STraTA performs self-training by further fine-tuning the strong
base model created by task augmentation on a broad distribution of
pseudo-labeled data. Our experiments demonstrate that STraTA can substantially
improve sample efficiency across 12 few-shot benchmarks. Remarkably, on the
SST-2 sentiment dataset, STraTA, with only 8 training examples per class,
achieves comparable results to standard fine-tuning with 67K training examples.
Our analyses reveal that task augmentation and self-training are both
complementary and independently effective.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06283">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>With the advent of end-to-end deep learning approaches in machine
translation, interest in word alignments initially decreased; however, they
have again become a focus of research more recently. Alignments are useful for
typological research, transferring formatting like markup to translated texts,
and can be used in the decoding of machine translation systems. At the same
time, massively multilingual processing is becoming an important NLP scenario,
and pretrained language and machine translation models that are truly
multilingual are proposed. However, most alignment algorithms rely on bitexts
only and do not leverage the fact that many parallel corpora are multiparallel.
In this work, we exploit the multiparallelity of corpora by representing an
initial set of bilingual alignments as a graph and then predicting additional
edges in the graph. We present two graph algorithms for edge prediction: one
inspired by recommender systems and one based on network link prediction. Our
experimental results show absolute improvements in $F_1$ of up to 28% over the

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Phrase representations derived from BERT often do not exhibit complex phrasal
compositionality, as the model relies instead on lexical similarity to
determine semantic relatedness. In this paper, we propose a contrastive
fine-tuning objective that enables BERT to produce more powerful phrase
embeddings. Our approach (Phrase-BERT) relies on a dataset of diverse phrasal
paraphrases, which is automatically generated using a paraphrase generation
model, as well as a large-scale dataset of phrases in context mined from the
Books3 corpus. Phrase-BERT outperforms baselines across a variety of
phrase-level similarity tasks, while also demonstrating increased lexical
diversity between nearest neighbors in the vector space. Finally, as a case
study, we show that Phrase-BERT embeddings can be easily integrated with a
simple autoencoder to build a phrase-based neural topic model that interprets
topics as mixtures of words and phrases by performing a nearest neighbor search
in the embedding space. Crowdsourced evaluations demonstrate that this
phrase-based topic model produces more coherent and meaningful topics than
baseline word and phrase-level topic models, further validating the utility of
Phrase-BERT.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06308">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Despite strong performance in many sequence-to-sequence tasks, autoregressive
models trained with maximum likelihood estimation suffer from exposure bias,
i.e. a discrepancy between the ground-truth prefixes used during training and
the model-generated prefixes used at inference time. Scheduled sampling is a
simple and often empirically successful approach which addresses this issue by
incorporating model-generated prefixes into the training process. However, it
has been argued that it is an inconsistent training objective leading to models
ignoring the prefixes altogether. In this paper, we conduct systematic
experiments and find that it ameliorates exposure bias by increasing model
reliance on the input sequence. We also observe that as a side-effect, it
worsens performance when the model-generated prefix is correct, a form of
catastrophic forgetting. We propose using Elastic Weight Consolidation as
trade-off between mitigating exposure bias and retaining output quality.
Experiments on two IWSLT'14 translation tasks demonstrate that our approach
alleviates catastrophic forgetting and significantly improves BLEU compared to
standard scheduled sampling.

<span><p>Event mentions in text correspond to real-world events of varying degrees of
granularity. The task of subevent detection aims to resolve this granularity
issue, recognizing the membership of multi-granular events in event complexes.
Since knowing the span of descriptive contexts of event complexes helps infer
the membership of events, we propose the task of event-based text segmentation
(EventSeg) as an auxiliary task to improve the learning for subevent detection.
To bridge the two tasks together, we propose an approach to learning and
enforcing constraints that capture dependencies between subevent detection and
EventSeg prediction, as well as guiding the model to make globally consistent
inference. Specifically, we adopt Rectifier Networks for constraint learning
and then convert the learned constraints to a regularization term in the loss
function of the neural model. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms baseline methods by 2.3% and 2.5% on benchmark datasets for
subevent detection, HiEve and IC, respectively, while achieving a decent

BERT-based LaBSE and BiLSTM-based LASER as our models, and the Bible as our

of bitext retrieval performance, as well as four intrinsic measures of vector
space alignment and isomorphism. We then examine a range of linguistic,
quasi-linguistic, and training-related features as potential predictors of
these alignment metrics. The results of our analyses show that word order
agreement and agreement in morphological complexity are two of the strongest
linguistic predictors of cross-linguality. We also note in-family training data
as a stronger predictor than language-specific training data across the board.
We verify some of our linguistic findings by looking at the effect of
morphological segmentation on English-Inuktitut alignment, in addition to
examining the effect of word order agreement on isomorphism for 66 zero-shot
language pairs from a different corpus. We make the data and code for our

two linguistic properties A and B, we introduce a set of new, non-existent,
linguistic items, give the model information about their variation along
property A, then measure to what extent the model learns property B for these
items as a result of training. We show this method at work for degree modifiers
(expressions like "slightly", "very", "rather", "extremely") and test the
hypothesis that the degree expressed by modifiers (low, medium or high degree)
is related to their sensitivity to sentence polarity (whether they show
preference for affirmative or negative sentences or neither). Our experimental
results are compatible with existing linguistic observations that relate degree
semantics to polarity-sensitivity, including the main one: low degree semantics
leads to positive polarity sensitivity (that is, to preference towards
affirmative contexts). The method can be used in linguistics to elaborate on

<span><p>Sequence models are a critical component of modern NLP systems, but their
predictions are difficult to explain. We consider model explanations though
rationales, subsets of context that can explain individual model predictions.
We find sequential rationales by solving a combinatorial optimization: the best
rationale is the smallest subset of input tokens that would predict the same
output as the full sequence. Enumerating all subsets is intractable, so we
propose an efficient greedy algorithm to approximate this objective. The
algorithm, which is called greedy rationalization, applies to any model. For
this approach to be effective, the model should form compatible conditional
distributions when making predictions on incomplete subsets of the context.
This condition can be enforced with a short fine-tuning step. We study greedy
rationalization on language modeling and machine translation. Compared to
existing baselines, greedy rationalization is best at optimizing the
combinatorial objective and provides the most faithful rationales. On a new
dataset of annotated sequential rationales, greedy rationales are most similar

<span><p>We address the problem of temporal sentence localization in videos (TSLV).
Traditional methods follow a top-down framework which localizes the target
segment with pre-defined segment proposals. Although they have achieved decent
performance, the proposals are handcrafted and redundant. Recently, bottom-up
framework attracts increasing attention due to its superior efficiency. It
directly predicts the probabilities for each frame as a boundary. However, the
performance of bottom-up model is inferior to the top-down counterpart as it
fails to exploit the segment-level interaction. In this paper, we propose an
Adaptive Proposal Generation Network (APGN) to maintain the segment-level
interaction while speeding up the efficiency. Specifically, we first perform a
foreground-background classification upon the video and regress on the
foreground frames to adaptively generate proposals. In this way, the
handcrafted proposal design is discarded and the redundant proposals are
decreased. Then, a proposal consolidation module is further developed to
enhance the semantic of the generated proposals. Finally, we locate the target
moments with these generated proposals following the top-down framework.
Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks show that our proposed
APGN significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

<span><p>A key solution to temporal sentence grounding (TSG) exists in how to learn
effective alignment between vision and language features extracted from an
untrimmed video and a sentence description. Existing methods mainly leverage
vanilla soft attention to perform the alignment in a single-step process.
However, such single-step attention is insufficient in practice, since
complicated relations between inter- and intra-modality are usually obtained
through multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose an Iterative Alignment
Network (IA-Net) for TSG task, which iteratively interacts inter- and
intra-modal features within multiple steps for more accurate grounding.
Specifically, during the iterative reasoning process, we pad multi-modal
features with learnable parameters to alleviate the nowhere-to-attend problem
of non-matched frame-word pairs, and enhance the basic co-attention mechanism
in a parallel manner. To further calibrate the misaligned attention caused by
each reasoning step, we also devise a calibration module following each
attention module to refine the alignment knowledge. With such iterative
alignment scheme, our IA-Net can robustly capture the fine-grained relations
between vision and language domains step-by-step for progressively reasoning
the temporal boundaries. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging
benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed model performs better than the
state-of-the-arts.

<span><p>Low-resource Relation Extraction (LRE) aims to extract relation facts from
limited labeled corpora when human annotation is scarce. Existing works either
utilize self-training scheme to generate pseudo labels that will cause the

Reinforcement Learning method to encourage pseudo label data to imitate the

the scenario where unlabeled data is sufficient, GradLRE handles the situation

documents. While the complex nature of event identity is previously studied
(Hovy et al., 2013), the case of events across documents is unclear. Prior work
on cross-document event coreference has two main drawbacks. First, they
restrict the annotations to a limited set of event types. Second, they
insufficiently tackle the concept of event identity. Such annotation setup
reduces the pool of event mentions and prevents one from considering the
possibility of quasi-identity relations. We propose a dense annotation approach
for cross-document event coreference, comprising a rich source of event

end, we design a new annotation workflow with careful quality control and an
easy-to-use annotation interface. In addition to the links, we further collect
overlapping event contexts, including time, location, and participants, to shed
some light on the relation between identity decisions and context. We present
an open-access dataset for cross-document event coreference, CDEC-WN, collected

<span><p>Pre-trained model such as BERT has been proved to be an effective tool for
dealing with Information Retrieval (IR) problems. Due to its inspiring
performance, it has been widely used to tackle with real-world IR problems such

rather than "random" negative samples would be beneficial for fine-tuning
pre-trained models on ranking tasks. However, it remains elusive how to
leverage hard negative samples in a principled way. To address the
aforementioned issues, we propose a fine-tuning strategy for document ranking,
namely Self-Involvement Ranker (SIR), to dynamically select hard negative
samples to construct high-quality semantic space for training a high-quality
ranking model. Specifically, SIR consists of sequential compressors implemented
with pre-trained models. Front compressor selects hard negative samples for
rear compressor. Moreover, SIR leverages supervisory signal to adaptively
adjust semantic space of negative samples. Finally, supervisory signal in rear
compressor is computed based on condition probability and thus can control
sample dynamic and further enhance the model performance. SIR is a lightweight
and general framework for pre-trained models, which simplifies the ranking
process in industry practice. We test our proposed solution on MS MARCO with
document ranking setting, and the results show that SIR can significantly
improve the ranking performance of various pre-trained models. Moreover, our

indispensable requirement for building high-quality conversational agents. In
order to generate better responses, some approaches have been proposed, such as
feeding extra information by collecting large-scale datasets with human
annotations, designing neural conversational models (NCMs) with complex
architecture and loss functions, or filtering out untrustworthy samples based
on a dialogue attribute, e.g., Relatedness or Genericness. In this paper, we
follow the third research branch and present a data filtering method for

The attribute weights are obtained via Bayesian Optimization (BayesOpt) that
aims to optimize an objective function for dialogue generation iteratively on
the validation set. Then we score training samples with the quality measure,
sort them in descending order, and filter out those at the bottom. Furthermore,
to accelerate the "filter-train-evaluate" iterations involved in BayesOpt on
large-scale datasets, we propose a training framework that integrates maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) and negative training method (NEG). The training
method updates parameters of a trained NCMs on two small sets with newly
maintained and removed samples, respectively. Specifically, MLE is applied to
maximize the log-likelihood of newly maintained samples, while NEG is used to
minimize the log-likelihood of newly removed ones. Experimental results on two

<span><p>Retrieval-based chatbot selects the appropriate response from candidates
according to the context, which heavily depends on a response selection module.
A response selection module is generally a scoring model to evaluate candidates
and is usually trained on the annotated positive response and sampled negative
responses. Sampling negative responses lead to two risks: a). The sampled
negative instances, especially that from random sampling methods, are mostly
irrelevant to the dialogue context and too easy to be fitted at the training
stage while causing a weak model in the real scenario. b). The so-called
negative instances may be positive, which is known as the fake negative
problem. To address the above issue, we employ pre-trained language models,
such as the DialoGPT to construct more challenging negative instances to
enhance the model robustness. Specifically, we provide garbled context to the
pre-trained model to generate responses and filter the fake negative ones. In
this way, our negative instances are fluent, context-related, and more
challenging for the model to learn, while can not be positive. Extensive
experiments show that our method brings significant and stable improvements on
the dialogue response selection capacity.

<span><p>This paper concerns the intersection of natural language and the physical
space around us in which we live, that we observe and/or imagine things within.
Many important features of language have spatial connotations, for example,
many prepositions (like in, next to, after, on, etc.) are fundamentally
spatial. Space is also a key factor of the meanings of many
words/phrases/sentences/text, and space is a, if not the key, context for
referencing (e.g. pointing) and embodiment.
</p>
<p>We propose a mechanism for how space and linguistic structure can be made to
interact in a matching compositional fashion. Examples include Cartesian space,
subway stations, chesspieces on a chess-board, and Penrose's staircase. The
starting point for our construction is the DisCoCat model of compositional
natural language meaning, which we relax to accommodate physical space. We
address the issue of having multiple agents/objects in a space, including the
case that each agent has different capabilities with respect to that space,
e.g., the specific moves each chesspiece can make, or the different velocities
one may be able to reach.
</p>
<p>Once our model is in place, we show how inferences drawing from the structure
of physical space can be made. We also how how linguistic model of space can
interact with other such models related to our senses and/or embodiment, such
as the conceptual spaces of colour, taste and smell, resulting in a rich
compositional model of meaning that is close to human experience and embodiment
in the world.

incorporating the pre-trained neural machine translation (NMT) model with

heavily relies on high-quality in-domain parallel corpora, limiting its

then insert lightweight adapters into the original NMT model to map the

<span><p>Domain adaptive pretraining, i.e. the continued unsupervised pretraining of a
language model on domain-specific text, improves the modelling of text for
downstream tasks within the domain. Numerous real-world applications are based
on domain-specific text, e.g. working with financial or biomedical documents,
and these applications often need to support multiple languages. However,
large-scale domain-specific multilingual pretraining data for such scenarios
can be difficult to obtain, due to regulations, legislation, or simply a lack
of language- and domain-specific text. One solution is to train a single
multilingual model, taking advantage of the data available in as many languages
as possible. In this work, we explore the benefits of domain adaptive
pretraining with a focus on adapting to multiple languages within a specific

enable a language model to both become domain-specific and multilingual.
Evaluation on nine domain-specific datasets-for biomedical named entity

languages show that a single multilingual domain-specific model can outperform
the general multilingual model, and performs close to its monolingual

this paper, we propose to use the machine reading comprehension (MRC) framework
to bridge this gap. We formalize predicate disambiguation as multiple-choice
machine reading comprehension, where the descriptions of candidate senses of a

predicate sense is then used to determine the semantic roles for that
predicate, and these semantic roles are used to construct the query for another
MRC model for argument labeling. In this way, we are able to leverage both the
predicate semantics and the semantic role semantics for argument labeling. We
also propose to select a subset of all the possible semantic roles for
computational efficiency. Experiments show that the proposed framework achieves

achieve effective and fair review assignments. Proposal classification aims to
classify a proposal into a length-variant sequence of labels. In this paper, we
formulate the proposal classification problem into a hierarchical multi-label
classification task. Although there are certain prior studies, proposal
classification exhibit unique features: 1) the classification result of a
proposal is in a hierarchical discipline structure with different levels of
granularity; 2) proposals contain multiple types of documents; 3) domain
experts can empirically provide partial labels that can be leveraged to improve
task performances. In this paper, we focus on developing a new deep proposal
classification framework to jointly model the three features. In particular, to
sequentially generate labels, we leverage previously-generated labels to
predict the label of next level; to integrate partial labels from experts, we
use the embedding of these empirical partial labels to initialize the state of
neural networks. Our model can automatically identify the best length of label
sequence to stop next label prediction. Finally, we present extensive results

<span><p>Non-autoregressive (NAR) transformer models have been studied intensively in
automatic speech recognition (ASR), and a substantial part of NAR transformer
models is to use the casual mask to limit token dependencies. However, the
casual mask is designed for the left-to-right decoding process of the
non-parallel autoregressive (AR) transformer, which is inappropriate for the
parallel NAR transformer since it ignores the right-to-left contexts. Some
models are proposed to utilize right-to-left contexts with an extra decoder,
but these methods increase the model complexity. To tackle the above problems,
we propose a new non-autoregressive transformer with a unified bidirectional
decoder (NAT-UBD), which can simultaneously utilize left-to-right and
right-to-left contexts. However, direct use of bidirectional contexts will
cause information leakage, which means the decoder output can be affected by
the character information from the input of the same position. To avoid
information leakage, we propose a novel attention mask and modify vanilla
queries, keys, and values matrices for NAT-UBD. Experimental results verify
that NAT-UBD can achieve character error rates (CERs) of 5.0%/5.5% on the
Aishell1 dev/test sets, outperforming all previous NAR transformer models.
Moreover, NAT-UBD can run 49.8x faster than the AR transformer baseline when

<span><p>Table filling based relational triple extraction methods are attracting
growing research interests due to their promising performance and their
abilities on extracting triples from complex sentences. However, this kind of

token pairs, which increases the possibility of overlooking some important
information during triple extraction. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a
global feature-oriented triple extraction model that makes full use of the
mentioned two kinds of global associations. Specifically, we first generate a
table feature for each relation. Then two kinds of global associations are
mined from the generated table features. Next, the mined global associations
are integrated into the table feature of each relation. This
"generate-mine-integrate" process is performed multiple times so that the table
feature of each relation is refined step by step. Finally, each relation's
table is filled based on its refined table feature, and all triples linked to
this relation are extracted based on its filled table. We evaluate the proposed
model on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show our model is

<span><p>Information seeking is an essential step for open-domain question answering

iterative approaches use predefined strategies, either applying the same
retrieval function multiple times or fixing the order of different retrieval
functions, which cannot fulfill the diverse requirements of various questions.
In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive information-seeking strategy for
open-domain question answering, namely AISO. Specifically, the whole retrieval
and answer process is modeled as a partially observed Markov decision process,
where three types of retrieval operations (e.g., BM25, DPR, and hyperlink) and
one answer operation are defined as actions. According to the learned policy,
AISO could adaptively select a proper retrieval action to seek the missing
evidence at each step, based on the collected evidence and the reformulated
query, or directly output the answer when the evidence set is sufficient for
the question. Experiments on SQuAD Open and HotpotQA fullwiki, which serve as

<summary class="article-expander__title">What are the attackers doing now? Automating cyber threat intelligence extraction from text on pace with the changing threat landscape: A survey. (arXiv:2109.06808v1 [cs.CR])</summary>

<span><p>Cybersecurity researchers have contributed to the automated extraction of CTI
from textual sources, such as threat reports and online articles, where
cyberattack strategies, procedures, and tools are described. The goal of this
article is to aid cybersecurity researchers understand the current techniques
used for cyberthreat intelligence extraction from text through a survey of
relevant studies in the literature. We systematically collect "CTI extraction
from text"-related studies from the literature and categorize the CTI
extraction purposes. We propose a CTI extraction pipeline abstracted from these
studies. We identify the data sources, techniques, and CTI sharing formats
utilized in the context of the proposed pipeline. Our work finds ten types of
extraction purposes, such as extraction indicators of compromise extraction,
TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures of attack), and cybersecurity keywords.
We also identify seven types of textual sources for CTI extraction, and textual
data obtained from hacker forums, threat reports, social media posts, and
online news articles have been used by almost 90% of the studies. Natural
language processing along with both supervised and unsupervised machine
learning techniques such as named entity recognition, topic modelling,
dependency parsing, supervised classification, and clustering are used for CTI
extraction. We observe the technical challenges associated with these studies
related to obtaining available clean, labelled data which could assure
replication, validation, and further extension of the studies. As we find the
studies focusing on CTI information extraction from text, we advocate for
building upon the current CTI extraction work to help cybersecurity
practitioners with proactive decision making such as threat prioritization,
automated threat modelling to utilize knowledge from past cybersecurity
incidents.

<span><p>Training a model for grammatical error correction (GEC) requires a set of
labeled ungrammatical / grammatical sentence pairs, but manually annotating
such pairs can be expensive. Recently, the Break-It-Fix-It (BIFI) framework has
demonstrated strong results on learning to repair a broken program without any
labeled examples, but this relies on a perfect critic (e.g., a compiler) that
returns whether an example is valid or not, which does not exist for the GEC
task. In this work, we show how to leverage a pretrained language model (LM) in
defining an LM-Critic, which judges a sentence to be grammatical if the LM
assigns it a higher probability than its local perturbations. We apply this
LM-Critic and BIFI along with a large set of unlabeled sentences to bootstrap
realistic ungrammatical / grammatical pairs for training a corrector. We
evaluate our approach on GEC datasets across multiple domains (CoNLL-2014,
BEA-2019, GMEG-wiki and GMEG-yahoo) and show that it outperforms existing
methods in both the unsupervised setting (+7.7 F0.5) and the supervised setting
(+0.5 F0.5).

approaches to OOD detection, model calibration and density estimation (language
modeling for text), have distinct behavior on these types of OOD data. Across
14 pairs of in-distribution and OOD English natural language understanding
datasets, we find that density estimation methods consistently beat calibration
methods in background shift settings, while performing worse in semantic shift

<span><p>Recent text generation research has increasingly focused on open-ended
domains such as story and poetry generation. Because models built for such
tasks are difficult to evaluate automatically, most researchers in the space
justify their modeling choices by collecting crowdsourced human judgments of
text quality (e.g., Likert scores of coherence or grammaticality) from Amazon
Mechanical Turk (AMT). In this paper, we first conduct a survey of 45
open-ended text generation papers and find that the vast majority of them fail
to report crucial details about their AMT tasks, hindering reproducibility. We
then run a series of story evaluation experiments with both AMT workers and
English teachers and discover that even with strict qualification filters, AMT
workers (unlike teachers) fail to distinguish between model-generated text and
human-generated references. We show that AMT worker judgments improve when they
are shown model-generated output alongside human-generated references, which
enables the workers to better calibrate their ratings. Finally, interviews with
the English teachers provide deeper insights into the challenges of the

as a classification problem, thus a cross-entropy log-loss objective is used
during training. However, discriminating true from false does not measure the
plausibility of a hypothesis, for all the hypotheses have a chance to happen,
only the probabilities are different. To fill this gap, we switch to a ranking
perspective that sorts the hypotheses in order of their plausibilities. With
this new perspective, a novel $L2R^2$ approach is proposed under the
learning-to-rank framework. Firstly, training samples are reorganized into a
ranking form, where two observations and their hypotheses are treated as the
query and a set of candidate documents respectively. Then, an ESIM model or
pre-trained language model, e.g. BERT or RoBERTa, is obtained as the scoring
function. Finally, the loss functions for the ranking task can be either

time, quantum computers have become much more powerful, and announcements of
major advances are frequently in the news.
</p>
<p>The mathematical techniques underlying both these areas have more in common
than is sometimes realized. Vector spaces took a position at the axiomatic
heart of quantum mechanics in the 1930s, and this adoption was a key motivation
for the derivation of logic and probability from the linear geometry of vector
spaces. Quantum interactions between particles are modelled using the tensor
product, which is also used to express objects and operations in artificial
neural networks.
</p>
<p>This paper describes some of these common mathematical areas, including
examples of how they are used in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in
automated reasoning and natural language processing (NLP). Techniques discussed
include vector spaces, scalar products, subspaces and implication, orthogonal
projection and negation, dual vectors, density matrices, positive operators,
and tensor products. Application areas include information retrieval,
categorization and implication, modelling word-senses and disambiguation,
inference in knowledge bases, and semantic composition.
</p>
<p>Some of these approaches can potentially be implemented on quantum hardware.
Many of the practical steps in this implementation are in early stages, and

different attribution techniques align with this assumption on realistic

<span><p>Language grounding aims at linking the symbolic representation of language
(e.g., words) into the rich perceptual knowledge of the outside world. The
general approach is to embed both textual and visual information into a common
space -the grounded space-confined by an explicit relationship between both
modalities. We argue that this approach sacrifices the abstract knowledge
obtained from linguistic co-occurrence statistics in the process of acquiring
perceptual information. The focus of this paper is to solve this issue by
implicitly grounding the word embeddings. Rather than learning two mappings
into a joint space, our approach integrates modalities by determining a
reversible grounded mapping between the textual and the grounded space by means
of multi-task learning. Evaluations on intrinsic and extrinsic tasks show that
our embeddings are highly beneficial for both abstract and concrete words. They
are strongly correlated with human judgments and outperform previous works on a
wide range of benchmarks. Our grounded embeddings are publicly available here.

<span><p>Dialogue systems powered by large pre-trained language models (LM) exhibit an
innate ability to deliver fluent and natural-looking responses. Despite their
impressive generation performance, these models can often generate factually
incorrect statements impeding their widespread adoption. In this paper, we
focus on the task of improving the faithfulness -- and thus reduce
hallucination -- of Neural Dialogue Systems to known facts supplied by a
Knowledge Graph (KG). We propose Neural Path Hunter which follows a
generate-then-refine strategy whereby a generated response is amended using the
k-hop subgraph of a KG. Neural Path Hunter leverages a separate token-level
fact critic to identify plausible sources of hallucination followed by a
refinement stage consisting of a chain of two neural LM's that retrieves
correct entities by crafting a query signal that is propagated over the k-hop
subgraph. Our proposed model can easily be applied to any dialogue generated
responses without retraining the model. We empirically validate our proposed
approach on the OpenDialKG dataset against a suite of metrics and report a
relative improvement of faithfulness over dialogue responses by 20.35% based on

present a data-efficient event extraction method by formulating event
extraction as a natural language generation problem. The formulation allows us
to inject knowledge of label semantics, event structure, and output
dependencies into the model. Given a passage and an event type, our model
learns to summarize this passage into a templated sentence in a predefined
structure. The template is event-type-specific, manually created, and contains
event trigger and argument information. Lastly, a rule-based algorithm is used
to derive the trigger and argument predictions from the generated sentence. Our
method inherently enjoys the following benefits: (1) The pretraining of the
generative language models help incorporate the semantics of the labels for
generative EE. (2) The autoregressive generation process and our end-to-end
design for extracting triggers and arguments force the model to capture the
dependencies among the output triggers and their arguments. (3) The predefined
templates form concrete yet flexible rules to hint the models about the valid
patterns for each event type, reducing the models' burden to learn structures
from the data. Empirical results show that our model achieves superior
performance over strong baselines on EE tasks in the low data regime and
achieves competitive results to the current state-of-the-art when more data

performance by bridging the gap between pre-training tasks and various
downstream tasks. Among these methods, prompt tuning, which freezes PLMs and
only tunes soft prompts, provides an efficient and effective solution for
adapting large-scale PLMs to downstream tasks. However, prompt tuning is yet to
be fully explored. In our pilot experiments, we find that prompt tuning
performs comparably with conventional full-model fine-tuning when downstream
data are sufficient, whereas it performs much worse under few-shot learning

attribute this low performance to the manner of initializing soft prompts.
Therefore, in this work, we propose to pre-train prompts by adding soft prompts

Pre-trained Prompt Tuning framework "PPT". To ensure the generalization of PPT,
we formulate similar classification tasks into a unified task form and
pre-train soft prompts for this unified task. Extensive experiments show that

masked language modeling (MLM) and denoising auto-encoding (DAE) tasks,
respectively. With the partially shared architecture and multi-task

<span><p>This paper is concerned with categorical structures for reversible
computation. In particular, we focus on a typed, functional reversible language
based on Theseus. We discuss how join inverse rig categories do not in general
capture pattern-matching, the core construct Theseus uses to enforce
reversibility. We then derive a categorical structure to add to join inverse
rig categories in order to capture pattern-matching. We show how such a
structure makes an adequate model for reversible pattern-matching.

<summary class="article-expander__title">Question Answering over Electronic Devices: A New Benchmark Dataset and a Multi-Task Learning based QA Framework. (arXiv:2109.05897v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05897">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Answering questions asked from instructional corpora such as E-manuals,
recipe books, etc., has been far less studied than open-domain factoid
context-based question answering. This can be primarily attributed to the
absence of standard benchmark datasets. In this paper we meticulously create a
large amount of data connected with E-manuals and develop suitable algorithm to
exploit it. We collect E-Manual Corpus, a huge corpus of 307,957 E-manuals and
pretrain RoBERTa on this large corpus. We create various benchmark QA datasets
which include question answer pairs curated by experts based upon two
E-manuals, real user questions from Community Question Answering Forum
pertaining to E-manuals etc. We introduce EMQAP (E-Manual Question Answering
Pipeline) that answers questions pertaining to electronics devices. Built upon
the pretrained RoBERTa, it harbors a supervised multi-task learning framework
which efficiently performs the dual tasks of identifying the section in the
E-manual where the answer can be found and the exact answer span within that
section. For E-Manual annotated question-answer pairs, we show an improvement
of about 40% in ROUGE-L F1 scores over the most competitive baseline. We
perform a detailed ablation study and establish the versatility of EMQAP across
different circumstances. The code and datasets are shared at
https://github.com/abhi1nandy2/EMNLP-2021-Findings, and the corresponding

<summary class="article-expander__title">Can Language Models Encode Perceptual Structure Without Grounding? A Case Study in Color. (arXiv:2109.06129v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06129">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Pretrained language models have been shown to encode relational information,
such as the relations between entities or concepts in knowledge-bases --
(Paris, Capital, France). However, simple relations of this type can often be
recovered heuristically and the extent to which models implicitly reflect
topological structure that is grounded in world, such as perceptual structure,
is unknown. To explore this question, we conduct a thorough case study on
color. Namely, we employ a dataset of monolexemic color terms and color chips
represented in CIELAB, a color space with a perceptually meaningful distance
metric.
</p>
<p>Using two methods of evaluating the structural alignment of colors in this
space with text-derived color term representations, we find significant
correspondence. Analyzing the differences in alignment across the color
spectrum, we find that warmer colors are, on average, better aligned to the
perceptual color space than cooler ones, suggesting an intriguing connection to
findings from recent work on efficient communication in color naming. Further
analysis suggests that differences in alignment are, in part, mediated by
collocationality and differences in syntactic usage, posing questions as to the
relationship between color perception and usage and context.
